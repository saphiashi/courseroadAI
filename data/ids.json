Models may probe how the impact of a technology depends on assumptions about future advancements in performance, and how quantitative performance targets can be estimated to inform investment and design decisions. Other projects may develop models to inform rational investments in a portfolio of technologies based on economic and environmental performance and scalability constraints. Both information-based (e.g., software and codified practices) and physical technologies will be discussed."
