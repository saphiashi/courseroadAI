The course starts from an overview of basic optical principles allowing an understanding of microscopic image formation and common contrast modalities such as dark field, phase, and DIC. Advanced microscopy imaging techniques such as total internal reflection, confocal, and multiphoton will also be discussed. Quantitative analysis of biochemical microenvironment using spectroscopic techniques based on fluorescence, second harmonic, Raman signals will be covered. We will also provide an overview of key image processing techniques for microscopic data."
