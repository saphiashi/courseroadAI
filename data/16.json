Explores advanced propulsion concepts that are not in use or well-developed, but that have established operation principles and could either contribute to environmental performance or are applicable to new aerospace services. Topics vary but may include: electric and turbo-electric aircraft propulsion; batteries, cryogenic fuels, and biofuels; combustion and emissions control concepts; propulsion for UAVs and urban air mobility; propulsion for supersonic and hypersonic vehicles; reusable space access vehicle propulsion; and propulsion in very low earth orbit. Includes a project to evaluate an advanced propulsion concept."

The performance of end-state designs is verified by testing. Though students develop a physical component or system, the project is formulated so those from any engineering discipline can participate. The focus is on the design process itself, as well as the complementary roles of human creativity and computational approaches. Designs are built by small teams who submit their work to a design competition. Pedagogy based on active learning, blending lectures with design and manufacturing activities.  Limited to 30 students.
