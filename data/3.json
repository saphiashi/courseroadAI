Examines ceramics structure, properties, and processing. Introduces archaeological perspectives and discusses how research into historical changes in ancient ceramic technologies has led to a deeper comprehension of past human behavior and societal development. Concludes by considering how studies of ancient technologies and techniques are leading modern materials scientists to engineer designs of modern ceramic materials, including glasses, concretes, and pigments.
